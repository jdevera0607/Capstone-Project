 Home-made Jewelry Store
 
# User Stories

This website will be used to sell home-made jewelry, along with helping inventory management.

This online store should help with understanding and figuring out what products sells well and whether a custom/bespoke jewelry is a more desirable feature.

Archiving will allow for past sales, as well as invoices provided for finances.

Allows for option of standard jewelries vs custom, made-to-order jewelries.

I wanted to create this website because I believe that in the long run, our store is an investment and having a middle man of using other websites take too much from our revenue. However, we will continue to sell in third-party products because we believe that it creates advertisements, and constant revenue. 

Having this original website will allow us to sell our custom-made products, while retaining a higher return on investment on very expensive, unique, and hard to find gems.

# About us -

Deverachi is ran by a 2 people Mom and Pop jewelry shop in Gainesville, FL. Our business name was created by merging our two last names together!

Since there are only of two of us, we strive to create home-made, and custom jewelry at the highest quality. We will try our best to always answer questions and ship as fast as possible! 

Our gems, stones, and metal are locally sourced, and are inspected by us.

We will try to pick as uniform of gems and stones, but in the real world, nothing is perfect. We will always discard ones that we find to be low-quality, or have visible defects.

# Shipping - 

Deverachi LLC will always opt for USPS or UPS, we will not use anything else unless stated otherwise.

We will ship purchases made before 3 P.M EST. 

# RETURNS - 
30 day return policy for any goods that are NOT custom, bespoke, or made-to-order jewelries. Any product that is on the site that is listed as reguarly on the shop page are considered standard products and will have a 30 day return policy.

Custom, bespoke or made-to-order jewelries will incur a 10% deposit fee that is NON-REFUNDABLE.

This is to protect our investments and our store to ensure that a buyer will maintain integrity on purchasing our product. 

Custom orders that are not up to customers' standard will be taken in on an return merchandise authorization (RMA) and inspected upon delivery. If manufacturer defects are found, it will be replaced with no charge, but no refunds will be issued. 
If no defects are found, the buyer is responsible for return shipment.

# Requirements -

This website will require important parts to make this website run smoothly.

| ID | Requirement |
| -| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 | Website will require a secure payment system that takes customers' information and charges them appropriately for their purchase. This system will also require a proper output display of price to ensure that a customer is looking at an accurate price and not paying for anything more.|
| 2 | The website should feature an inventory system. This is important on both customers and manager side, to know the current amount of inventory to order more, and if there is enough quantity of a product should a buyer want to purchase a larger amount.
| 3 | Social Media dedicated to the website/store. Many social media apps helpful with marketing for digital presence of a store. Having a social media allows us to announce newly made products, or any other interesting updates that allow us to interact with our customers, along with helping out with simple support questions.
| 4 | Phone/Mobile friendly. I plan on testing this website with my mobile phone, and hopefully some friends' phones, to ensure that the store is flexible in its display and allows a wide variety of users to view the store.
| 5 | Working support and contact. The store should have an operational support 'contact us' page that allows customers to text/email us for any questions that they may have. Customers are important, and ensuring that they are satisfied is a priority.

Researching of what to purchase, we encourage our customers to always ask questions before buying! 

Getting sized properly. Because our products are home-made, we do not have a one size fit all. For the best fitment, please direct to the measurement page. 

Purchase a product - Once a product is purchased, we will be notified that a product is purchased and the inventory size will change accordingly.

Logistics - Once a product is purchased, we can manually create shipping labels through a third-party website that we are confident in using, and have used with a lengthy record. If issues occur, we will change accordingly.

Shipping - Product will be dropped off at the logistics facility, with insurance to ensure that both parties are protected. 

Delivery - Buyer will receive their product, and hopefully everything arrives in perfect condition! 

Leave a review - We make our products with love, and we hope that the customers will love it too! The more positive reviews, the better!

Returns/Refunds/Exchanges - Not everything goes according to plan! If necessary, we will take returns and refund for standard products. Refer to returns for custom-made jewelries.
