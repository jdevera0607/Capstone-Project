About us -

Deverachi is ran by a 2 people Mom and Pop jewelry shop in Gainesville, FL. Our business name was created by merging our two last names together!  Since there are only of two of us, we strive to create home-made, and custom jewelry at the highest quality. We will try our best to always answer questions and ship as fast as possible! 
Our gems, stones, and metal are locally sourced, and are inspected by us. We will try to pick as uniform of gems and stones, but in the real world, nothing is perfect. We will always discard ones that we find to be low-quality, or have visible defects.

Shipping - 

Deverachi LLC will always opt for USPS or UPS, we will not use anything else unless stated otherwise.

RETURNS - 
30 day return policy for any goods that are NOT custom, bespoke, or made-to-order jewelries. Any product that is on the site that is listed as reguarly on the shop page are considered standard products and will have a 30 day return policy.
Custom, bespoke or made-to-order jewelries will incur a 10% deposit fee that is NON-REFUNDABLE. This is to protect our investments and our store to ensure that a buyer will maintain integrity on purchasing our product. 
Custom orders that are not up to customers' standard will be taken in on an return merchandise authorization (RMA) and inspected upon delivery. If manufacturer defects are found, it will be replaced with no charge, but no refunds will be issued. 
If no defects are found, the buyer is responsible for return shipment.
